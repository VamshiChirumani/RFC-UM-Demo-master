**This is a RFID location tagging application.**

It is developed using .Net Framework and RFC OS (A software that was developed by RF Controls).

This software receives RFID tagID and the coordinates of the tag from RFC OS which is connected to RFID antennas. 
With the data received the application visualizes the location of the tag.

We can assign images for the tag. This application can also be used to track the people in the region. If a 
RFID tag is attached to the person the scanners can detect the location. By simply adding a image to the tagID in the database
We can see the real time location of the person in the application.
We can also keep the track of the person during his office hours.

This data can be used to calculate the productivity of the person.
